# Playground Interviews

A key way we learn how to learn is by looking to others for inspiration. This is
an interview series to explore the ways individuals have learned about
decentralized systems, and learning in general.

## Who to interview?

Our goal with this interview process is to provide a point of inspiration for
individuals reflecting on their own learning process. As such we want to explore
diverse experiences, both in how individuals have learned and how they applied
that learning.

### Proposing an Interview

If you have someone you think would make an awesome interviewee, create an issue
tagged with `proposal` (feel free to do this for yourself if you think you'd be
great :wink: )

## Process
Each interview starts with an issue. In this the interviewee should answer the
following questions in a couple sentences each, with the goal of not taking more
than 15 minutes. This is not meant to be serious or arduous, just to provide a
starting point for a more in-depth conversation.

### 1. Preliminary Questions
1. What do you primarily work on? (field, project, ideas, any descriptors)
2. What were the resources/people/things/ideas the you depended on when learning
   about it?
3. What are the ideas or mental models from your current work that is most
   broadly applicable in other stuff you do?
   
Not all of these have to be answered, and the interviewee can add any other
points as they see fit.

### 2. Construct Interview
Once we have a starting point, the interviewee and interviewer collaborate to
create a direction for the interview. This should focus on the specific ideas
and concepts raised in the preliminary answers and take the form of one or two
guiding questions.

This part is meant to be fun and exploratory, a good way to go about it is to
drop references to things the interviewee and interviewer think connect to the
topics and ideas discussed. 

### 3. Conduct Interview
The interview can be conducted over whatever medium works best for all the
particpants. To the extent possible all material should be recorded.

Any participant in the interview can chose to withold sections of it from public sharing.

### 4. Document and Summarize

Once the actual interview is completed we need to share the information. Both a
summary and transacript should be created along with the hosting of any
recordings and put into a file in the [interviews](/interviews) folder.

#### Artifacts:
Specific pieces of information should be extracted from the interview if they're
in there:

- Resources and Links
- Direct pieces of advice
